        The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous
        mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and
        is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the
        wild members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm
        cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.
        Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability
        to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat
        registries.

          Cats initiated this process of domestication, and on their own terms.
          Unlike other species that foraged in early human settlements, they
          have continued to live in close quarters with humans ever since
          without their wild nature changing greatly. The genome of house cats
          differs in only a small number of ways from that of its wild kin.
          Their legs are somewhat shorter and their coats more variously
          colored. Even so, as Abigail Tucker has noted, “Cats have changed so
          little physically during their time among people that even today
          experts often can’t tell house tabbies from wild cats. This greatly
          complicates the study of cat domestication. It’s all but impossible to
          pinpoint the cats’ transition into human life by examining ancient
          fossils, which hardly change even into modernity.”

          Unless they are kept indoors, the behavior of house cats is not much
          different from that of wild cats. Though the cat may regard more than
          one house as home, the house is the base where it feeds, sleeps and
          gives birth. There are clear territorial boundaries, larger for male
          cats than for females, which will be defended against other cats when
          necessary. The brains of house cats have diminished in size compared
          with their wild counterparts, but that does not make house cats less
          intelligent or adaptable. Since it is the part of the brain that
          includes the fight-or-flight response that has shrunk, house cats have
          become able to tolerate situations that would be stressful in the
          wild, such as encountering humans and unrelated cats.
